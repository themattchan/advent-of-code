by reasoning:

1. no i, o, l. so if these chars occur then increment by 1

2. two different, nonoverlapping pairs

3. one increasing sequence

requirements 2+3 means that the shortest change will be to create a sequence of the form

nn(n+1)(n+2)(n+2)

and because we increment from the right,
this string must be the last 5 characters.
